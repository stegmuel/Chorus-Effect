# Chorus-Effect
In this repository we propose a Python implementation of the "Chorus Effect".

The Jupyter notebook report can be found in the "Report" folder. 
The application can be run from the "App" folder. 

The following packages might need to be installed :
- sounddevice
- tkinter
- wave

To launch the application run the following command from the "App" folder : python ChorusApp.py 
If this magnificent window shows up, you succeeded!

# Chorus Effect
In this repository we propose a Python implementation of the "Chorus Effect".

The Jupyter notebook report can be found in the "Report" folder or using the following link :
http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/stegmuel/Chorus-Effect/blob/master/Report/ChorusEffect_report.ipynb
 
The application can be run from the "App" folder. 

The following packages might need to be installed :
- sounddevice
- tkinter
- wave

To launch the application run the following command from the "App" folder :

*python ChorusApp.py*

If this magnificent window shows up, you succeeded!

You can either load a mono .wav from the browser, or record yourself for a settable duration. You can play and save the output signal as a stereo .wav file.

Have fun!
